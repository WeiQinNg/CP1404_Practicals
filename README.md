# CP1404 Practicals
## By Ng Wei Qin
Practical work for IT@JCU CP1404

This repository stores the practicals for the programming module CP1404 for James Cook University Singapore.
I am a student taking this module while undertaking the degree course Bachelor of Science Majoring in Aquaculture Science and Technology.

3 main lessons I have learnt about "clean code" are:
- Abide by good naming conventions as this will allow efficient identification of each code segment.
- Achieve maximum parsimony to allow faster running of codes.
- Follow the Single Responsibility Principle for functions to enable clear segregation of the performance of each function and reusability.
