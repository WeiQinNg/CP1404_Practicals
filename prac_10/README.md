# Practical 10
### Write some short but thoughtful comments about each of the following:
- regarding the estimates that you did for practical tasks, how was your accuracy and did your accuracy improve during the course of the subject?
- regarding code reviews, what have you learned from both being reviewed and doing reviews?
- regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

1. My estimates of the time taken for practicals have reduced drastically from hours to within 40 mins. My current coding accuracies are still not perfect as there are still many things that are unknown to me, and things that I have yet to learn. However, I am much quicker in implementing the right codes over the course of the subject as I learn from my mistakes and my peers. 
2. I have learnt the importance of being open-minded to constructive criticisms, and that criticisms have to be specific. They must point out areas of strengths and areas for growth for them to be helpful, actionable, and constructive for the receiver. Additionally, I have learnt to use GitHub to create branches to make reviews before combining them with the main branch.
3. I would have combined the practicals for the earlier weeks (not truncating but just combining) to cater extra time for object-oriented programming and kivy.
